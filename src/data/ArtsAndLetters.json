            "So I'm going have to rethink that particular book project. But for the life of me I can not, in the present circumstances, see the internet as anything other than the force that is holding that fabric together. In my own case, I was working on a book ( one that developed, curiously, out of an essay of mine, entitled it's all over, posted here at the point a little over a year ago ) that was going to articulate how the internet is destroying the fabric of human community.",
            "But I am saying there is a logic, if you like, that governs the totality of life on earth, and human history has been much more significantly shaped by that logic than by any of the stories we have told ourselves about who we are and what we're up to. In our ignorance of nature, we are ill-positioned to consider with suitable wonder how strange it is that human history can still be transformed overnight not just by viruses or bacteria but by the most rare of midsize mammals. Enough about microscopic life; I would like to wrap things up here with a few words about the furtive yet on occasion perfectly visible pangolin."
